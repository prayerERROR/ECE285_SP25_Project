# Image generation with limited dataset (Pokemon)

## Overview

Image generation with limited dataset, we use Pokemon dataset in practice.

## Motivation

The Pokemon franchise contains hundreds of uniquely designed characters with distinct visual styles that present an interesting challenge for generative models. Creating a specialized model for Pokemon generation would allow:

1. Generation of novel Pokemon designs that maintain stylistic consistency

2. Exploration of controllable features (type, color scheme, evolution stages)

3. Practical application of recent advances in diffusion models to a specific domain

## Related Work

We refer papers as follow:

1. Diffusion Models: Introduced by Sohl-Dickstein et al. (2015), refined by Ho et al. (2020) with DDPM

2. Latent Diffusion Models: Developed by Rombach et al. (2022), which operate in compressed latent space

3. Stable Diffusion: A popular implementation of LDM for text-to-image generation

4. Domain-specific image generation: Similar projects have focused on anime characters, logos, and other specialized visual domains

## Novelty

Our project has following novelty:

1. Domain specialization: Creating a model specifically optimized for Pokemon character generation

2. Attribute conditioning: Allowing control over Pokemon type, abilities, or evolution stage

3. Style consistency: Maintaining the distinct Pokemon aesthetic while generating novel designs

4. Dataset curation: Creating a high-quality dataset of Pokemon images with appropriate metadata

## Training Strategy

**Stage 1 - Autoencoder Training**:

- Train a VAE/autoencoder on Pokemon images
- Objective: Reconstruct images accurately while compressing to latent space
- Metrics: Reconstruction loss, perceptual similarity

**Stage 2 - Diffusion Model Training**:

- Train diffusion model in the latent space
- Add noise gradually in forward process
- Learn to denoise in reverse process
- Incorporate conditioning (text embeddings or class labels)

**Stage 3 - Fine-tuning**:

- Fine-tune the model with specific conditioning
- Balance between diversity and fidelity
- Implement regularization to prevent overfitting on limited data
